\section{Introduction}
This work is to address how targeted micro-robots carrying drugs locate cancer cells, we present a mathematical model based on chemotaxis-driven movement and ligand-receptor binding. The model consists of three key equations describing the chemoattractant concentration, free micro-robots, and bound micro-robots.




\section{Mathematical model}
We are going to model the targeted delivery of drugs by micro-robots to cancer cells. The key steps include three parts. The release of micro-robots in the bloodstream. The navigation of micro-robots towards the tumor site, which we assume is guided by a chemical gradient (chemotaxis) or other targeting mechanisms. The binding of micro-robots to cancer cells.

We will focus on chemotaxis as a primary mechanism. The mathematical model will involve diffusion of chemoattractants (chemical signals) from the tumor, movement of micro-robots towards higher concentrations of chemoattractants, and binding kinetics when micro-robots come in contact with cancer cells. We will model the system using partial differential equations (PDEs) for the chemoattractant concentration and the density of micro-robots.

The chemoattractant is produced by the tumor cells. We model its diffusion and decay:
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}=D_c\nabla^{2}c-kc+S(\textbf{x}),
\end{equation*}
where $c(\textbf{x},t)$ is the concentration of chemoattractant at position $\textbf{x}$ and time $t$, $D_c$ is the diffusion coefficient ($\text{0.1 mm}^2$/s) of the chemoattractant, $\nabla^{2}$ is the Laplacian operator in 3D, $k$ is the decay rate ($\text{0.01 s}^{-1}$), and $S(\textbf{x})$ is the tumor  source term located at some region (1.0 nM/s in tumor region).

The micro-robots move by chemotaxis and diffuse randomly due to blood flow and other factors. The equation for the free micro-robots (movement via chemotaxis) is
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}=D_{\rho}\nabla^{2}\rho-\nabla\cdot(\chi \rho \nabla c)-k_{b}\rho\delta_{\Omega_{T}}+k_{u}b,
\end{equation*}
where $\rho(\textbf{x},t)$ is the density of micro-robots at position $\text{x}$ and time $t$, $D_{\rho}$ is the diffusion coefficient ($\text{0.01 mm}^2$/s) of micro-robots, $\nabla$ is the gradient operator in 3D, $\chi$ is the chemotactic sensitivity ($\text{0.1 mm}^2$/nM$\cdot$s), $k_{b}$ is the binding rate ($\text{0.1 s}^{-1}$) to cancer cells (only in the tumor region $\Omega_{T}$), $k_{u}$ is the unbinding rate ($\text{0.01 s}^{-1}$) since we assume bound micro-robots can detach at a low rate, and $\delta_{\Omega_{T}}$ is the indicator function that equals to 1 inside tumor region $\Omega_{T}$, 0 otherwise.

The bound micro-robots attached to cancer cells satisfy
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial b}{\partial t}=k_{b}\rho\delta_{\Omega_{T}}-k_{u}b,
\end{equation*}
where $b(\textbf{x},t)$ the density of bound micro-robots.

Figure \ref{ThreeDSim} simulates a 3D chemotaxis-driven micro-robot drug delivery system. The simulation is configured within a $\text{1 mm}^{3}$ spatial domain, discretized with a grid of 30 points along each dimension. To ensure numerical stability, a time step of 0.001 seconds is used, and the total simulated time is 2 seconds. The key biochemical parameters governing the system include diffusivities for the chemoattractant and micro-robots ($D_c=0.1$ and $D_\rho=0.01$, respectively), a chemotactic sensitivity of $\chi=0.1$, and binding/unbinding rates of $k_b=0.2$ and $k_u=0.01$. The environment is initialized with a tumor modeled as a spherical region at the center with a radius of 0.15 mm, which acts as a continuous source of chemoattractant. The population of micro-robots is introduced into the system via an initial injection across the entire plane at $x=0$. At each time step of the simulation loop, zero-flux Neumann boundary conditions are enforced to contain all elements within the modeled domain. The chemoattractant field is updated by calculating its diffusion, incorporating a constant production term from the central tumor, and subtracting a natural decay term. Concurrently, the micro-robot population undergoes movement driven by a combination of random diffusion and a directed chemotactic velocity proportional to the spatial gradient of the chemoattractant ($\nabla c$), guiding them toward higher concentrations. Binding and unbinding kinetics, governed by their respective rates, are exclusively calculated for micro-robots located within the tumor region. Finally, after all updates are computed, the concentrations of all species are clipped to ensure non-negativity, maintaining physical realism before proceeding to the next iteration. We compute the 3D Laplacian using central differences, calculate the chemotaxis term $\nabla\cdot(\rho\nabla c)$, and implement zero-flux boundaries by copying adjacent grid values. Visualization of the simulation data is achieved through multiple complementary methods. A slice plot provides a cross-sectional view of the total micro-robot concentration, revealing internal gradients within the volume in Figure \ref{ThreeDSim}(a). To render the three-dimensional structure of the robot swarm, an isosurface is generated at a threshold of $10\%$ of the maximum concentration in Figure \ref{ThreeDSim}(b). Finally, for detailed quantitative analysis, 2D cross-sectional slices are extracted through the center of the domain and overlaid with a tumor mask to clearly distinguish the robotic population from the tumor region in Figure \ref{ThreeDSim}(c).
The simulation successfully models targeted drug delivery using chemotaxis, with robots accumulating in the tumor region due to binding and chemoattractant gradients.
